# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
I made a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer as a mini project while learning Data structures and algorithm to visualize the difference between the usual comparision sorting techniques and counting sort techniques.

I used pygame for rendering the visualization and pysimplegui for the gui part.

There are two choices:

1)Selection sort->comparision sort

2)Counting sort->counting sort
